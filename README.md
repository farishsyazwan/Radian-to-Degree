# Radian to Degree
This Pyton script will convert Radian to degree value.

This is my first Python script that has more than 50 lines. Yes, I'm a noob. I also don't have idea how to use GitHub

Run this Python script however you like. If you don't know how, refer to YouTube.

1. Insert your radian value.
2. Insert how many decimal point(how many number after the decimal point) you like. Only 0 to 14 allowed.
3. It will show the degree value
